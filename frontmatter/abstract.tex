\abstract

In general, the chapters described below are expected in a bachelor's thesis.
Some of the listed chapters may not be applicable to your thesis, and additional chapters covering special topics may be needed.
A good approach is to describe each major concept/task in a separate chapter, and describe minor related concepts in sections/subsections within the chapters.

The top-level (numbered) list corresponds to the main chapters.
The second level itemization lists the contents that should be covered in that chapter.
The headings typeset in \textbf{boldface} should be sections on their own.
In \emph{italic} are more detailed comments.
